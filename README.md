The Dataset
Data for this task can be gathered with the Udacity simulator itself. Indeed, when the simulator is set to training mode, the car is controlled by the human though the keyboard, and frames and steering directions are stored to disk. 

Udacity training set is constituted by 8036 samples. For each sample, two main information are provided:

three frames from the frontal, left and right camera respectively
the corresponding steering direction (I,R) where I is the image and R is the stearing angel.
